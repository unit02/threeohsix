# threeohsix
306 | Orchard Project

#How To Get Started

1) Download the zip file from github and unzip in your desired directory OR type [git clone https://github.com/Lavitasy/threeohsix.git] into your command line

2) Ensure you have ros [indigo] installed on your machine. Follow the steps outlined in the following link if not http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation

3) Before starting the simulation the user can configure some of the orchard settings (number of rows, number of picker robots, and the width of rows) by typing
[python GUI.py] in the /threeohsix directory. A window will then pop up prompting the user to enter their own values.

4) Type [bash run.sh] or [bash run_one_window.sh] from the /threeohsix directory, and the simulation will begin!
